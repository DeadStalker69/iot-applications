    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2> List of some IoT Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>IoT Applications in agriculture</li>
      <li> IoT applications in consumer use</li>
      <li> IoT application in healthcare</li>
      <li> IoT applications in insurance</li>
      <li> IoT applications in manufacturing</li>
      <li> IoT applications in retail</li>
      <li> IoT applications in transportation</li>
      <li> IoT applications in utilities/ energy</li>
      <li> IoT applications in wearables</li>
      <li> IoT applications in traffic monitoring</li>
      <li> IoT applications in fleet managemnet</li>
      <li> IoT applications in hospitality</li>
      <li> IoT applications in smart grid and energy saving</li>
      <li> IoT applications in water supply</li>
    </ul>
      <h2> Activity 1: IOT Apps</h2>
        <p> We needed to seartch about IOT applications, wat they are and their main features. IOT applications are software services or software as a service (SaaS) which display and analyse the data availible on its network, which is collecetd from its own set of sensors. it can strategically analys the data and use the data to execute any sort of process in real time over the internet. IOt applications are integrated with ine another and work together to create a cohesive automated enviornment which is also secure and needes minimal human intervention.
          <br> <br>
          Some examples of IOT applicatios are:
          <ul>
            <li>Home security</li>
            <li> Motion detection</li>
            <li> activity tracker</li>
            <Li> Augmented reality glasses</Li>
            <li> Smart watch</li>
            <li> Smart water bottle</li>
            <li> Smart city</li>
            <li> Traffic management</li>
            <li> Livestock tracking</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2> Activity 2: Smart Building</h2>
        <p> In thsi activity, we try to find out what smart actually means, how a building can be smart, i.e., what all features does it need to be called smart building and then some exmples of smart features in a building. 
          <br> A smart building is a place where the residents can feel safe while also creating an enviornment which enhances the quality of life by using minimal resources (sustainable). Quality of life improvements in this regard is automation of various daily life activities which seem like a hassle to do, like dish washing. In a samrt building, ease of life is kept at fore front and various comples and tidius processes are broken down into smaller and much smaller tasks. 
          <br> <br>
          A few fatures that a smart building must have:
          <ul>
            <li> Comfort</li>
            <li> High security</li>
            <li> Visualization</li>
            <li> Analzying</li>
            <li> Eco-friendly</li>
            <li> Power optimiszation</li>
            <li> sensing and acting upon the signals recieved from the devices.</li>
          </ul>
          <br> 
          Some smart building scenerios:
          <ul>
            <li> <b> Fire system -</b> A smart building may have a fire alarm and sprinkling system such that it can not only detect the sourc of fire (and accordingly sprinkle water or notify to throw sand) but also provide a notification to all the people in the building and provide appropriate pathway to exit, as far away as possible from source of fire along with calling in SOS services.</li>
            <li> <b> Temperature monitoring system -</b> A smart building with have sensors to know the temperature and humidity level of all places in the building and keep them at optimal levels. It turns on sir conditioning and heating system as per the requirement, but is also smart enough to not waste energy as locations with minimal access (like set the temperature in meeting room or party hall only on the day of usage and retrieves the day of access via a calender, along with timing of uage.). </li>
            <li> <b> Water monitoring -</b>a smart system in which water quality in the tanks is always monitored and alerts are sent to specific users of a tank if requires maintance, along with push notification to when it goes offline and when water line will be restores back.</li>
            <li> <b> Motion controlled lighting -</b> This feature have now become a staple to call any living or non living space "smart". Thsese are basically light system controlled via voice, with multiple color in lights and can detet it a person is present in a room or not and switch on and off accordingly.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2> Activity 3: Control Interface</h2>
        <p> In the third and final activity, we had to think of one smart building application, think of its high level features, provide a list of parts and users of the application. Our team have thought of smart parking system. 
          <br> The features of our parking system are:
          <ol>
            <li> <b> Smartparking system with smpty slot notification</b> <br>
            Our system comes with a mobile app for daily users where they can login at any time and know the current empty parking slots along with directions to the slot. This uses pressure paltes to determine if a car is present at a particular slot or not. Along with app, for onetime users, a screen will be provided at the entrance with qr code which they can scan and get to know about an empty sot where they can go and park.</li>
            <li> <b>Number plate scanning </b> <br>
            A number plate scanner will also b eplaces at entry and exit for logging the information about any car that enters the parking lot, from a safety point of view. Along with that, this system can also be used know entry and exit time of a car for paid parking systems and automticaly cahrge the user.</li>
          </ol>
          This system be used staff members, residents and also the guests of the building. Emergency services can also have specil provision in this system. The parts needed in thsi system are:
          <ul>
            <li> Weight sensor/ Pressure plates</li>
            <li> Amplifier</li>
            <li> Online database</li>
            <li> QR code generator</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
